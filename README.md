## Features

- Upload images of handwritten digits in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format.
- Predict the number represented in the uploaded image using a trained ANN model.
- Display prediction results and confidence scores.
- User-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask, Keras, TensorFlow
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript
- **Image Processing**: Pillow
